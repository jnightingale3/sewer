Notes on final version of allgrabdata_datefix.csv, by columns:
Data was extracted and compiled from various excel ABCWUA spreadsheets, with various formatting.

1) Interceptor 
Names of three interceptors:
Valley (142A)
Westside (2024)
Edith

2) Manhole 
Abbreviated names of the locations of manholes where each grab sample was collected.
The name(s) on the right side of the = sign are those used by ABCWUA. Some manholes were referred to by various names, in which case these have been standardised:
12motel = 12th. & Motel ( MH # G 14 - 802) (NB not a real location!) = csfour4 (all 12motel records changed to csfour4)
12stove = 12th. & Stover ( MH # K 13 - 572)
blakeco = Blake & Coors ( MH # N10-581) / Coors & Blake
broadwa = Broadway ( MH # N14 - 364)
csfour4 = CS # 4 = 12motel
edicord = Edith & Cordero ( MH # J15 - 205)
florken = Floretta & Kensington ( MH # E 14 - 931) / Kensington & Florretta
ltwenty = Lift station 20 ( MH # P12 - 845) - 
oldcoor = Old Coors (North of Gonzales) ( MH # K11-576) / Old Coors South of Churchill (North of Gonzales as of 21-Mar-07)
oldcoso = Old Coors before LS # 1
plantin = Plant Influent ( MH # PPH III Distribution Box) / TP2.3X  (Plant Influent)
seconds = 2nd. St  MH # L 14 - 623) / 2nd st. & Southern
tijeras = TP2.1 ( Tijeras )
tp21val = TP2.1 Valley
willloc = Willow & Locust ( MH # E 16 - 811)
yuccesp = Yucca & Esperonza  / Yucca & Esperanza ( 57th & Avalon starting 3-21-12 )

3) Date
Converted from various formats used by ABCWUA personnel into standardised dd-mm-yy format, mainly using cell formatting functions in LibreOffice Calc, but some recalcitrant problems were fixed manually.

4) Temp
Sewer temperature of grab samples, as recorded by ABCWUA personnel. Almost all are in Fahrenheit, but a few were recorded in Celsius (those below 32F). All measurements >32 were converted to Celsius prior to analysis.

5 - 9) Other measures from sewer grab samples which were not analysed
pH - sewer pH
Tot.Sulphide - total sulphide (mg/l)
Dis.Sulphide - dissolved sulphide (mg/l)
Tot.Iron     - total iron (mg/l)
FerrousFe    - ferrous iron (mg/l)
